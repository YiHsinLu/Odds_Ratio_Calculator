# Odds Ratio Calculator
There exist many online calculators for odds ratio and its confidence interval, but we didn't know their formulas and which tests they used. This repository includes an R Shiny app and its source code, and we utilize the Fisher test for confidence intervals and p-values. On the other hand, we also compute their power with odd ratio=2 and level $\alpha$ =0.05.

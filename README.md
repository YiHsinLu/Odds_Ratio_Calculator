# Odds Ratio Calculator
There exists lots of online calculator for odds ratio and its confidence interval but we didn't know their formula and which testing they used. This repository includes a R shiny app and its source code, and we use fish test for confidence interval and p-value. On the other hand, we also compute their power with odd ratio=2 and level $\alpha$ =0.05.
